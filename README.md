# Employment deprivation

This study investigates the link between the level of employment deprivation of an area and the percentage of residents of that area who have never worked.

It combines two datasets: one that contains the labour market statistics of all residents 16 and over for each MSOA and one that ranks the 32.844 LSOAs in England by deprivation level. The first dataset covers England and Wales, the second dataset England.

This study considers two questions: what are the five MSOAs in England with the highest percentage of people between 16 and 24 years old who have never worked, and is there a correlation between the percentage of people who have never worked and the employment deprivation ranking of the area where they live?


The report does not require any specialised knowledge or understanding.
